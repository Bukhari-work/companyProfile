At the intersection of research, policy, and practice, Aulia Khairina is a public health professional with a collaborative, resilient, and strategic approach to advancing stronger and more equitable health systems. She is a researcher and consultant at the Center of Health Administration and Policy Studies, Universitas Indonesia (CHAMPS UI), and also serves as a lecturer, where she teaches courses on health policy, health systems, and healthcare management. Aulia holds an undergraduate degree from Universitas Indonesia and a master’s degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).

Her research covers health financing, health systems, and global health. In health financing, she has examined the financial independence of public hospitals, Sharia-compliant hospital sustainability, and funding support for drug-resistant tuberculosis patients. In health systems, her projects include primary healthcare reform evaluation, patient satisfaction surveys, and post-training behavioural change assessments for non-communicable disease prevention. In global health and disease control, she has contributed to malaria mortality estimation for the World Health Organization, strengthened public–private mix approaches for tuberculosis control, and developed DR-TB advocacy and capacity-building programs. She also collaborates under the BRIGHT Grant with Tsinghua University on research exploring how to enhance access to essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries.

Beyond research and teaching, Aulia is active in capacity building and international policy forums. She has designed and delivered training for health professionals on topics such as regulatory impact assessment, primary health centre management, health financing, and hospital strategic planning. She coordinated T20 Indonesia 2022 – Task Force 6 on Global Health Security and COVID-19, producing 19 policy briefs for G20 leaders, and continues to contribute to policy dialogues and collaborations at both national and global levels.
