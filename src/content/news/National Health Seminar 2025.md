The National Health Seminar 2025, conducted on 17 July 2025, with the theme “Quality Service Transformation: Accessible, Efficient, and Equitable”, served as the culminating event of the 57th Anniversary of BPJS Kesehatan. The seminar marked a significant milestone in facilitating multi-stakeholder dialogue to strengthen Indonesia’s Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) system. Held at the Balai Purnomo Prawiro Universitas Indonesia, the event brought together over 500 in-person participants and was livestreamed to thousands of online viewers via YouTube and social media, demonstrating a highly inclusive level of participation.
Keynote Speakers & Dignitaries

## The seminar featured a lineup of key national figures, including:
- Vice Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia
- Governor of East Nusa Tenggara (NTT)
- Vice Governor of East Java
- President Director of BPJS Kesehatan
- Director of Human Resources & General Affairs, BPJS Kesehatan

## Seminar Highlights

Dynamic discussions unfolded across main panel sessions, focusing on digital innovation in healthcare services, addressing service access disparities in remote areas, and strengthening inter-sectoral governance for JKN.
Evaluation and Impact

Evaluation results from the seminar were overwhelmingly positive:
- 91% of participants rated the seminar content as highly relevant.
- 87% of participants expressed readiness to apply the insights gained in their workplace or academic environment.
- Participants described the seminar as “distinctly different, as it was more substantive and brought in diverse voices from the field.”

This seminar marked a leap forward in meaningful public engagement in strengthening Indonesia's social health insurance system. More than a ceremonial gathering, it served as a substantive forum for shaping new directions in national health policy, grounded in field experience and scientific evidence.

As part of the broader Scientific Forum, this seminar also reflects a progressive step in the evidence-based transformation of JKN services. In addition to enhancing the quality of national scientific publications, the forum helped bridge academic knowledge and public policy needs, fostering a more responsive, inclusive, and sustainable health system.
