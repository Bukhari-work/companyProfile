In 2022, the Center for Health Administration and Policy Studies (CHAMPS), Faculty of Public Health Universitas Indonesia, played a central role as the main host of the Global Health Security and COVID-19 Task Force (TF6) under Think20 (T20) Indonesia. Led by Prof. Hasbullah Thabrany, the Task Force was dedicated to formulating strategic recommendations for G20 leaders on strengthening global health architecture and resilience.
TF6 worked across 10 priority policy areas, including:
1. Equitable access and production of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines to confront COVID-19 globally.
2. Rapid alert and surveillance of infectious pathogens to control outbreaks.
3. Investment and reform of health systems to ensure resilience and achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC).
4. Prevention and preparedness using a One Health approach at the human–animal–environment interface.
5. Addressing inequalities in access to essential medicines and services.
6. Enhancing regional cooperation as a bridge between global and national responses.
7. Digital transformation and medical information sharing to safeguard continuity of essential health services.
8. Laboratory readiness for biodefense and global health security.
9. Strengthening health cooperation to combat non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and malnutrition.
10. Advancing innovation, sustainable health financing, and political leadership for global health security.

TF6 served as a hybrid platform for international and national experts, facilitating collaboration, knowledge exchange, and capacity building, especially for stakeholders from developing countries. Activities included webinars, public discussions, policy dialogues, and hybrid meetings covering the ten policy areas.
Each session featured international experts and abstract presentations from researchers and practitioners, fostering dialogue on innovative solutions to global health challenges. Participation extended across universities, research institutes, NGOs, and think tanks worldwide, strengthening global commitments to health system resilience and the pursuit of UHC by 2030.
By September 2022, TF6 had successfully produced 19 policy briefs, providing evidence-based recommendations for G20 leaders. These briefs addressed urgent health challenges and offered practical solutions to strengthen global preparedness, recovery, and resilience in the post-pandemic era.
Through its leadership in TF6, CHAMPS reaffirmed its role as a hub for advancing global health policy and collaboration, ensuring that the voices of developing countries contribute to shaping the future of global health governance.
