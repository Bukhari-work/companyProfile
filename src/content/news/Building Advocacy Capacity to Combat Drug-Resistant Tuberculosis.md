**From 5-9 August 2024**, the Center for Health Administration and Policy Studies (CHAMPS) hosted a Capacity Building on Advocacy for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB).

The program was designed to empower advocates across Indonesia with the essential skills and knowledge needed to strengthen TB advocacy efforts.

This initiative brought together key stakeholders from diverse regions, fostering collaboration to advance TB policies and mobilize resources. Participants were equipped with practical tools in data-driven decision-making, strategic communication, and policy analysis, critical competencies for effective advocacy in public health.

Throughout the sessions, participants engaged in hands-on exercises to design, implement, and evaluate advocacy strategies. They shared best practices, built strong networks, and developed targeted advocacy plans that emphasized cross-sectoral collaboration and resource mobilization, with a particular focus on addressing DR-TB challenges among Indonesiaâ€™s most vulnerable populations.

By the end of the program, participants emerged with new skills, perspectives, and actionable strategies. This strengthened capacity is expected to support more coordinated and impactful advocacy, contributing to long-term efforts to reduce TB incidence and mortality in Indonesia.

CHAMPS remains committed to building a strong foundation for sustained advocacy empowering professionals and communities alike to take an active role in ending DR-TB.
Join the fight: Unite, advocate, and end DR-TB!
