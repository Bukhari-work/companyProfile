The Hospital Management Program (HMP) is one of CHAMPS FPH UI’s flagship initiatives, focusing on strengthening hospital governance and service quality in Indonesia. Through a series of training sessions, seminars, and conferences, HMP provides a platform for knowledge exchange and capacity building in hospital administration.

Among its major activities is the Hospital Administration Conference (HAC), held annually. Following the success of the first two HACs, CHAMPS FPH UI broadened the scope of the event to include international speakers and participants, launching the 1st International Conference on Hospital Administration (ICHA) in 2016.

## The 1st ICHA (2016)
The inaugural ICHA carried the theme “Quality and Competitiveness of Hospitals in the ASEAN Economic Community Era”. It aimed to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of pressing hospital management issues while offering practical strategies to enhance hospital quality. The conference drew active participation, with 57 attendees on the first day, 49 on the second, and 78 on the final day.

## The 2nd ICHA (2017)
Building on its success, CHAMPS FPH UI co-organized the 2nd ICHA in 2017 with the Directorate of Research and Community Engagements (DRPM) and the Graduate Study of Hospital Administration at Universitas Indonesia. The conference explored the theme:
“Current and Future Hospital Needs: Better Insights on Innovation to Answer Hospital Administration Challenges.”
The objective was to unite healthcare and hospital stakeholders to discuss strategies for advancing high-quality hospital services while addressing both current and future challenges in hospital management. The event attracted a diverse group of participants, including hospital professionals, academics, public health officers, and representatives from non-governmental health organizations.
The 2nd ICHA drew 133 participants on the first day (1 November 2017) and 103 on the second, featuring a total of 99 scientific papers—with 37 oral presentations and 62 poster presentations.
