**On November 5 2024**, the Center for Health Administration and Policy Studies (CHAMPS) FPH UI convened a policy dialogue titled “Closing the Gap: Optimizing Thyroid Screening in Indonesia” at the JW Marriott Hotel, Jakarta. The event brought together health leaders, policymakers, and experts to address gaps in thyroid screening and explore evidence-based, sustainable strategies to strengthen Indonesia’s health resilience.

The dialogue underscored the importance of multi-sectoral collaboration and emphasized integrating thyroid screening into the country’s national health programs. Key speakers including experts from the Ministry of Health, Economist Impact, and leading health organizations shared critical insights on improving early detection of thyroid disorders, especially among high-risk groups such as newborns and pregnant women.

Discussions highlighted the socio-economic impact of untreated thyroid conditions and the urgent need to build stronger healthcare infrastructure to support widespread screening. Several priority areas for improvement were identified:

Education of Frontline Workers: Expanding training for community-based healthcare providers to improve service delivery.

Data Generation: Strengthening data collection on at-risk groups such as pregnant women and monitoring treatment outcomes.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Evaluating universal screening to guide sustainable funding strategies.

Optimal Patient Journey: Ensuring reliable diagnostics and seamless pathways for timely treatment.

Strengthening the Penta Helix: Encouraging collaboration between policymakers, healthcare providers, academics, and communities.

By fostering dialogue and collaboration, this event laid the groundwork for policy innovations that will advance thyroid screening as a pillar of Indonesia’s national health agenda. The outcomes of the discussion are expected to contribute to building a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable healthcare system.
