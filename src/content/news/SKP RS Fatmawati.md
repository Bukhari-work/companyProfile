The Center for Health Administration and Policy Studies (CHAMPS), in collaboration with Fatmawati General Hospital, successfully conducted an Employee Satisfaction Survey during the first half of 2025. This initiative reflects the long-term partnership and shared commitment between the two institutions to strengthen organizational performance and employee well-being.

The survey evaluated the hospital’s managerial performance from the perspective of employees, covering both medical and non-medical staff. By capturing feedback across all levels, the initiative aims to highlight strengths, identify areas for improvement, and guide evidence-based strategies that foster a more supportive and effective workplace.

Recognizing that employee perspectives are critical to service excellence, the survey ensured that every voice—whether from frontline medical staff or supporting teams—was heard and valued in shaping future management practices.

The findings will provide Fatmawati General Hospital with actionable recommendations to enhance staff satisfaction, reinforce organizational culture, and ultimately improve the quality of healthcare services delivered to the community.

This collaboration underscores CHAMPS’ mission to advance health systems through evidence-driven approaches and Fatmawati General Hospital’s vision to deliver excellent, efficient, and people-centered health services.
